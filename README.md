R codes for regression discontinuity designs with right-censored data as described in Cho et al., "Analysis of Regression Discontinuity Designs Using Censored Data"

There are two files, code_FRD_JSR.R and code_SRD_JSR.R.  The former implements fuzzy regression discontinuity designs with right-censored data, while the latter implements the strict regression discontinuity designs with right-censored data.
